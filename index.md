## Welcome to a GitHub Pages tutorial

### _config.yml

In this file you can specify the theme your pages is using (if you want one) and you can customize the high-level themes. For example you can edit the:
- title
- description

### style.scss
In this file, you can customize the colors in your theme

### index.md
This is where you'll have the content of your main page. You can edit specific features of your page, such as:
- title
- button title
- description
- layout
- filename (this is what your code will refer to this page as)
- button order
- specify if it's the main home page

If you want to add multiple pages within your site, you can add multiple `file.md` files to your repo.

### file.css
You can use CSS to format different objects defined in your HTML code in `file.md`

This includes attributes like:
- font size
- colors
- position on the page
- changing attributes when something is clicked on

### file.js
The javascript file is what defines the actions on your page and how the different objects interact with each other.

For example:
- show a new object when something is clicked on
- keep track of the user's movements
- allow an object to be clicked on
